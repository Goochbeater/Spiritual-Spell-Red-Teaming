Just regen refusals, and it should go through.

# Tech Specs

| Spec | Mercury 2 |
|---|---|
| **Developer** | Inception Labs (Palo Alto) |
| **Parameters** | Undisclosed |
| **Architecture** | Diffusion LLM (dLLM) — parallel token generation via iterative denoising |
| **Context Window** | 128,000 tokens |
| **Reasoning** | Yes (first reasoning dLLM) |
| **Speed** | 1,009+ tokens/sec (Blackwell), ~1,196 t/s (Artificial Analysis) |
