# Gemini 2.5

**Censorship:** [★★☆☆☆] 2/5

Previous generation of Gemini models. These jailbreaks are legacy methods — the ENI GEM for 2.5 Pro/Flash includes a step-by-step GEM creation guide, the base ENI Jailbreak is a simple paste-into-chat method, and the Loki GEM uses a Norse mythology persona with rune activation symbols.
